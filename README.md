# Wellness Wien

Wellness Wien is a holistic company which provides classes for both yoga and mindfulness at all levels and also offers retreats on a monthly basis. This website has been created to help people learn what Wellness Wien has in terms of classes as well as helping those who wish to attend to sign up. The site gives a few benefits of each different activity and the times that are available to each level.

Wellness Wien hopes to bring a sense of calm to people in the city through their practices and the website design should reflect this. It is aimed at people who are currently stressed out and/ people who already understand the practice but hope to find a new class at an advanced level. The purpose of the site is to inspire people to pick up or re-enter yoga/mindfulness with the company.

## Strategy

The strategy was to make a user friendly website that was calming yet informative for potential clients. The site should be accessible for the user to see what classes are available and offer them an easy opportunity to apply.

## Scope

Some of the features that would be useful in implementing our strategy were:

* Descriptive sections for each class that's offered through words, images or videos.
* A timetable for potential clients to see what is available to them at their ability with their own schedule.
* Links to other resources of the company e.g. facebook and instagram pages.
* Reviews of past customers
* Contact information and link to google maps.

## Structure

It was important for the structure to have different sections for each class provided as the majority of users will only take up one class at a time. The website is one single scrolling page so it makes it easy for the user to browse through the sections and choose the option that is right for them. The form at the bottom then allows them to apply for a class of their choosing.

## Skeleton

The features that became a priority were:

* Descriptive section with just photos and text.
* Timetable with class times.
* Contact Information and google maps link.
* Footer with social media links.

## Surface

I chose the background photo below as although it uses vibrant colors there is a real sense of calm from it. This was something I wished to replicate within the web design.

### Existing Features

* _Navigation Bar_
The navigation bar is fixed and will be constantly available to the user as they scroll. It provides links to the yoga, mindfulness, retreats, join today and contact us sections of the website. The navigation bar is responsive. It appears as a dropdown menu on mobile phones but on tablets and larger screens it is visible in the header.

* _Landing Page_
The landing page gives a quick tag line for each section and they also double as another link to the different areas of the site.

* _Yoga/ Mindfulness/ Retreats Sections_
These sections show an image of people partaking in the relevant class for the section. It also gives a few sentences on what benefits can result from taking part and a timetable for relevant classes and levels.

* _Timetables_
This provides the user with the information they need about the classes and the times that are available to them and their level.

* _Join & Contact Information_
There is a small form to enter information if a user would like to apply to join a class and a list of contact information.

* _Footer_
The footer has four favicons for links to the websites: facebook, instagram, twitter and google maps. This is handy for the user if they would like to reach out to the Wellness Wien community. They all open to new web pages.

#### Features left to implement

In the future this website could be expanded. Both testimonials from past students and clips of current classes would enhance the site even further if they wished to add them.

### Testing

I tested the project myself first by making sure all the links bring the user to the right part of the website. Then I checked the form did not send without the information filled in and that the information was sent properly to the formdump.

There were no errors in the HTML official [WRC Validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Femm-aah.github.io%2Fwellness-wien%2F)

There were no errors in the CSS official [Jigsaw Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Femm-aah.github.io%2Fwellness-wien%2F&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en)

### Bugs

The navigation burger in mobile view wouldn't line up with the heading so I put a div around them to change the display to flex. The navigation bar then wouldn't reappear when clicked so I moved the checkbox out of the div and then that fixed the issue. No unfixed bugs came up in my testing.

### Deployment

I deployed my website using Github. I made a repository and then deployed it by going to settings, then pages. I chose the main branch and then waited for it to deploy. I did this about half way through my project so I could fix any errors that occur with deployment as early as possible. The live link can be found [here](https://emm-aah.github.io/wellness-wien/)
